 * The default scroll range is front-loaded (`start 0.9` → `start 0.35`): once
 * the element's top passes 35% of the viewport the value has already reached
 * `to` and stays there for the rest of the scroll. That guarantees the
 * animation always finishes, so content can never be left parked at an offset
 * (and therefore effectively hidden) further down the page.
 *
 * That range is tied to the element's *top*, so for a container taller than
 * the viewport it completes almost immediately and everything below sits
 * static. Pass a range ending on the element's `end` for tall containers —
 * that spreads the travel across the container's own height.
